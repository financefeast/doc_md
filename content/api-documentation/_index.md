# API Documentation

In order to start using Financefeast Web API, you will need to obtain your API key. An API key consists of two strings, 
one called Key ID which always appears in your dashboard, and Secret Key, which appears only once when generating 
it. Make sure you keep both in your hands.

### [Web API v1]({{< relref "/api-documentation/api-v1/_index.md" >}})
 
Current version of the Financefeast API is ['v1']

### [How-To Code Examples]({{< relref "/api-documentation/how-to/_index.md" >}})

Basic usage examples showing [how to do specific tasks]({{< relref "/api-documentation/how-to/_index.md" >}}) 
using the Financefeast API. We can show you how to access the data you need without writing a single line of code.

### [Client SDK]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}})

Financefeast also provides software development kits ("SDKs") [here]({{< relref "/api-documentation/client-sdk/_index.md" >}})
