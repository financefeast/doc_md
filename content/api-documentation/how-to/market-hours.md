## See if the Market is Open

With GET requests to our [`/v2/calendar`]({{< relref "/api-documentation/api-v2/calendar.md" >}}) and [`/v2/clock`]({{< relref "/api-documentation/api-v2/clock.md" >}}) endpoints, you can check if the market is open now, or view what times the market will be open or closed on a particular date.
