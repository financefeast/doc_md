## View Account Information
By sending a GET request to our [`/v2/account`]({{< relref "/api-documentation/api-v1/account.md" >}}) endpoint, you can see various information about your account, such as the amount of buying power available or whether or not it has a [PDT flag](https://financefeast.markets/learn/pattern-day-trader/).
