# How-To

Welcome to the how-to section of our documentation! Here, you'll find some examples of how to do specific tasks using
the financefeast API in supported programming languages.

Before running these examples, it is recommended that you set the following environment variables to the corresponding 
values found on your dashboard. Please be aware of whether you're using the values for your paper trading account or 
for your live trading account.
```
APCA_API_BASE_URL
APCA_API_KEY_ID
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY
```
On Linux, this can be done with `export ENV_VAR_NAME=DASHBOARD_VALUE`. (You'll probably want to add them to 
your `~/.bash_profile` so they stay set when the machine restarts.) On Windows, you can instead 
use `setx ENV_VAR_NAME "DASHBOARD_VALUE"`. After running these commands, you'll want to open a new command 
prompt window so the variables are available.
