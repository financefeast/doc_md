The assets API serves as the master list of assets available for trade and data
consumption from financefeast. Assets are sorted by asset class, exchange and symbol.
Some assets are only available for data consumption via Polygon, and are not
tradable with financefeast. These assets will be marked with the flag
`tradable=false`.
