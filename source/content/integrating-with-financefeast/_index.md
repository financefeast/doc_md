# Integrating with Financefeast

At Financefeat we love to see other projects interacting with our API, so we're using OAuth2 to provide an authorization and authentication framework
for you to use when building your own web application. OAuth2 allows Financefeast customers to authorize you to obtain a short lived access token that
allows you to call our API using their subscription.

# We're Here to Help

Building an OAuth enabled web application can be daunting, but we have put together a [guide]({{< relref "./oauth/oauth_guide/oauth_guide.md" >}}) to get you started.
Need help? Can't find what you're looking for here? Post a message on [community slack](https://financefeast.slack.com) and one of the Financefeast
team or the community will help you.
