The Non Renounceable Rights Issue endpoint returns stock rights issue information. Non Renounceable Rights Issue 
refers to an offer issued by a corporation to shareholders to purchase more shares of the corporation 
(usually at a discount). Unlike a renounceable right, a non-renounceable right is not transferable, 
and therefore cannot be bought or sold.
